[LIFULL HOMEâ€™s database](https://www.nii.ac.jp/dsc/idr/lifull) offers five million real floorplans, from which we retrieved 117,587. The database does not contain bubble diagrams. We used the floorplan vectorization algorithm [1] to generate the vector-graphics format, later converted into room bounding boxes and bubble diagrams, which can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p707nojabzf0nhi/AAB4UPwW0EgHhbQuHyq60tCKa?dl=0).<br/>
