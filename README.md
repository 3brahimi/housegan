![alt text](https://github.com/ennauata/housegan/blob/master/refs/sample.jpg "Sample")
[LIFULL HOMEâ€™s database](https://www.nii.ac.jp/dsc/idr/lifull) offers five million real floorplans, from which we retrieved 117,587. The database does not contain bubble diagrams. We used the floorplan vectorization algorithm [1] to generate the vector-graphics format, later converted into room bounding boxes and bubble diagrams. The processed data from Chen *et al.* [1] can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p707nojabzf0nhi/AAB4UPwW0EgHhbQuHyq60tCKa?dl=0).<br/>
